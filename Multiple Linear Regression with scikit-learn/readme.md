# Multiple Linear Regression with scikit-learn

### Use of scikit-learn to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization. The data for this project consists of the very popular Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper. 

### Steps:

    1. Introduction and Overview

    2. Load the Data

    3. Relationships between Features and Target

    4. Multiple Linear Regression Model

    5. Feature Selection

    6. Model Evaluation Using Train/Test Split and Model Metrics

    7. Interaction Effect (Synergy) in Regression Analysis

- Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
- Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE
- Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
